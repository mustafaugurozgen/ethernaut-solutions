# Level 14 - Gatekeeper Two

- extcodesize opcode â†’ address as input, returns code size of given address. It is used to define if an address belongs to EOA or contract. [HOWEVER, it is not safe to use](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/extcodesize-checks/).
- A contract does not have source code during construction. For this reason, if a contract calls another contract during constructor method, it does not have a code yet.
- Rest is simple. Use below contract and attack during deployment.
