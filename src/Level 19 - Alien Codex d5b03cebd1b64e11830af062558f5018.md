<aside>
ðŸ“¨ Assuming the dynamic array starts at a slot locationÂ `p`, then the slotÂ `p`Â will contain the total number of elements stored in the array, and the actual array data will be stored atÂ `keccack256(p)`

- In this example, first state variable is owner since it is inherited from Ownable contract. Second state variable is boolean and third is bytes32 dynamic array.
- In this case, storage is as follows:
    - Slot 0 â†’ 0x000000.. + boolean + owner address
    - Slot 1 â†’ Length of dynamic array
    - Slot 2 â†’ Empty ..
- Dynamic array data is stored as follows:
    - hash(length slot) + index*bit/256
    - First element â†’ hash(1) + 0*256/256
    - Second element â†’ hash(1) + 1
    - â€¦
- In this case, we attack revise method to change data of first slot.
    - Before all, we decrease length by 1, and underflows to max value. That way we can access any data in array.
    - First, calculate storage point of first element of array. `web3.utils.keccak256(web3.utils.encodePacked(1))`
    - There can be 2^256 slots in storage. Last storage address is 0xffffâ€¦ffff.
    - If we give index as 2^256 - first element address, we overwrite to slot 0.
- There we write our address to that index of array. It will overwrite slot 0.
